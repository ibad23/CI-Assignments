## Assignment Overview

### Assignment 1: Evolutionary Algorithms
This assignment focused on the fundamentals of evolutionary computation, including:
- Genetic Algorithms (GA)
- Selection, crossover, and mutation strategies
- Fitness evaluation and convergence analysis  

### Assignment 2: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) & Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
In this assignment, we explored swarm intelligence through:
- **PSO**: Simulated agents adjusting velocities based on personal and global bests.
- **ACO**: Pathfinding behavior inspired by real ant foraging.

### Assignment 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) & Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
This assignment dealt with learning from interaction and unsupervised clustering:
- **RL**: Implemented Q-Learning and value iteration in grid environments.
- **SOM**: Visualized high-dimensional data clustering.
